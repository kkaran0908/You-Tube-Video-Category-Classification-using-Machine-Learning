### Steps and Models used
-  Scrap the data from youtube.
- Preproess the data
- I have applied two different kinds of model such as LSTM, BiLSTM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- We have done some feature engineering as well by combining the title of the video with the description part of the video
- We are getting optimal results when using LSTM.
- You can check the results, in different notebook files.
